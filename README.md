# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-for-Automatic-Attendance-Sytem
This project is about the Face Detection and Face Recognition using OpenCV libraries where it will recognize the face of a person and marks his/her attendance.

Step by step procedure

Step 1: Please install Python 2.7 IDE and OpenCV 3.4.0 library files.
Step 2: Install SQliteStudio for the database.
Step 3: Run the command pip install numpy and pip install pillow in the cmd prompt by going into Python27 folder.
Step 4: Copy paste the cv2.pyd into your installed path of Python27.
Step 5: opencv-3.4.0-vc14_vc15\opencv\sources\data\haarcascades Go to this path and copy paste the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file in a separate folder.
Step 6: After the clean installation, run datasetGenerator.py file, this will generate the dataset images of a person in a "dataset" folder.
Step 7: Run trainner.py , which is used to train the images. This will create trainer.yml in a folder.
Step 8: Then run faceRecognizerGenerator.py then BOOM! your face will recognized
Step 9: At a press of 'q' button your attendance will be marked but before that you need to create tables in SQlite studio.
Step 10: You should create two tables one for Regsitering and one for marking attendance.

This project is very helpuful for final year project.
